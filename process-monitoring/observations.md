## Process Discovery (ps)

- The system is running multiple background services and user processes.
- Top CPU-consuming processes include [/usr/bin/containerd, /usr/bin/python3/home/devcontainers], which is expected.
- Top memory-consuming processes include [/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd://, /usr/bin/containerd].
- No single process appears to be consuming excessive CPU or memory.
